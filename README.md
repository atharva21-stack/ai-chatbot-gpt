# Advanced AI Chatbot Project
==========================

## Overview
This project is an advanced AI chatbot application that integrates OpenAI's GPT model for generating responses. It features a real-time chat interface, user authentication, conversation history management, and multi-session support. The application is built using a modular architecture with TypeScript for type safety and utilizes Docker for simplified local environment setup.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with Material-UI components
- **State Management**: Redux
- **Backend**: Express.js server with plugin-based architecture
- **Database**: MongoDB for user profiles and conversations, Redis for session management
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT model with GenAIClient interface for future integrations
- **Containerization**: Docker

## Core Features
- **Real-time Chat Interface**: Engage with AI responses in real-time.
- **User Authentication**: Secure signup and login functionality.
- **Conversation History Management**: Persistent storage of conversations.
- **Multi-session Support**: Handle multiple user sessions simultaneously.

## Design and Usability
- **User Interface**: Clean, modern design using Material-UI.
- **UX Features**: Real-time message updates, auto-scroll to latest messages, loading states during AI responses, and user-friendly error handling.

## Architecture
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with loosely coupled components.
- **Three-Tier Architecture**: Client (Frontend), Server (Application Layer), and Data Layer.
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containerization for easy deployment and scaling.

## Security
- **Session-based Authentication**: Secure password hashing and Redis for temporary session storage.
- **Secure Cookie Configuration**: Environment variable management to avoid secrets in the codebase.

## Scalability and Performance
- **Current Optimizations**: Docker containerization, Redis caching, and Webpack optimization.
- **Scalability Considerations**: Loose coupling of data stores and application layers for independent scaling.

## Getting Started
1. **Create OpenAI API Key**: Assign it to the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
2. **Install Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and running.
3. **Build and Start Containers**: Run `npm start`.
4. **Access Service**: Available at `http://localhost:3000`.
5. **Monitor Logs**: Use `docker compose logs -f`.
6. **Tear Down Containers**: Run `npm stop`.

## Future Enhancements
- **Polish AI Response Format**
- **Add File Upload Support**
- **Conversation Export/Sharing**
- **Integrate More AI Providers**
- **Performance and Security Enhancements**
